Instructions:
Create a random forest classifier to predict cab driver's tip; based on the trip data, will they receive a tip or not. If they receive a tip, will it be low, standard or good.

Create a Jupyter notebook (or Python script) and perform the following steps:

Load the data and select the salient features.

Split the data into training and test sets.

Create the random forest classifier and optimize the model to achieve a prediction accuracy of 95% (or higher).

Note: at a minimum, you should identify suitable values for the following: criterion, max_depth, max_features, min_samples_split, n_estimators. The max_depth should not exceed 15.

Make predictions with the unseen data in new_trips.csv.

Summarize the results.
